BUILDING THE C5 GENERIC COLLECTION LIBRARY FOR C#/CLI
Updated 2008-02-10

The C5 library can be built by opening the solution file C5.sln in the
current directory with Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 or Microsoft
Visual C# 2008 Express Edition and performing a build all.

Or execute 'msbuild C5.sln' from the command line in this directory.

This will build C5 in file C5/bin/Release/C5.dll 

Building all in the C5.sln solution will also build these projects:

  * The 'PreProcess' project generates some of the C5 sources by
    preprocessing files.  This is necessary for the C5 build.

  * The 'docNet' project generates on-line documentation; see below.

  * The 'UserGuideExample' project compiles the examples from chapter
    11 of the technical report ITU-TR-2006-76

  * The 'nunit' project compiles the unit tests but does not run them;
    see below.  An enormous number of compilation errors will result
    unless you have NUnit 2 installed.  The project is configured for
    NUnit version 2.2.9 and was tested with that version.

The build should complete with a few dozen compilation warnings.

------------------------------------------------------------

Generating the online documentation

 * Build C5 in Debug mode

 * Run docNet/dodoc.cmd, e.g. by double-clicking in Explorer

 * Press return

The generation process should take less than 20 seconds.

The generated documentation is in directory docNet/docbuild/ and
subdirectories.  The start page is docNet/docbuild/frames.htm

Note: The generated online documentation is currently incomplete.
Please refer to the Technical Report (ITU-TR-2006-76) instead.

Running the NUnit tests

Prerequisites:

 * You must have NUnit installed (version 2.2.x). 

 * The nunit project (nunit/nunit.csproj) must include a reference to
   to the installed nunit-framework.dll.  Add the reference by
   right-clicking "References" under "nunit" in Visual Studio's
   Solution Explorer.

Steps to build and run unit tests:

 * Build the project called "nunit".  

 * Start NUnit, select File > Open > nunit/bin/Debug/nunit.dll, or
   simply double-click nunit/bin/Debug/nunit.dll

 * Press Run in the NUnit user interface

There are more than 1400 NUnit test cases which should execute in less
than 30 seconds.  All should pass when C5 is built in Debug mode.

Note 1: The Release builds of C5 use randomized hashing for
efficiency, whereas the Debug builds use deterministic hashing to
simplify testing.  This means that approximately 13 hashtable test
cases will fail (harmlessly) when C5 is built and tested in Release
mode, using File > Open > nunit/bin/Release/nunit.dll

Note 2: C5 version 1.1.0 includes the test case
support.itemops.EqualityComparers.SeqequalityComparerViaBuilder4 which
works on VS2008 C#/CLR version 3.5, but failed on VS2005 with C#/CLR
2.0 due to a bug in that platform.  Omit this test case if you need to
build C5 on VS2005 with C#/CLR 2.0.
